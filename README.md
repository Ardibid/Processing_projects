## Processing sketches <br>
These are processing sketches from Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 projects. They include data visualization, data processing, some agent based AI systems. <br>

### 1- CUMINCAD Data visualization
This is a data fetching and data visualization project on CUMINCAD data base.

### 2- Motion Grammer Modeling Interface
A basic interface to model roled surfaces for my thesis project. It is integrated with a Grasshopper definition to control an industrial robotic arm to fabricate the resulted forms.

### 3- Swarm Intelligence
As a part of landscape design project for reviving south west Pennsylvania coal mines, I developed these swarm models to simulate the vegetation growth on the contaminated soil.<br>
